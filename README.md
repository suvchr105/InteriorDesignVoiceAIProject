# üè† Interior Design Voice AI Agent ‚Äî Ekam Apps Technical Assessment

This project automates the qualification of interior design leads using voice AI agents, Airtable, and the n8n automation platform. It is designed as part of the Ekam Apps Technical Assessment (April 2025) and simulates a fully automated outbound voice call workflow that collects lead information and updates records based on real call results.

---

## üìå Project Overview

The Interior Design Voice AI Agent system comprises:

- **Voice AI Agent**: Built using [Vapi.ai](https://vapi.ai) and powered by an OpenAI LLM.
- **Two n8n Workflows**:
  - **Workflow 1: Outbound Call Launcher**
  - **Workflow 2: Call Result Processor**
- **Airtable**:
  - `Leads` table ‚Äì stores lead details and call status
  - `Call Records` table ‚Äì logs all call metadata, duration, transcripts

## üß† Workflow Summary

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Workflow 1: Outbound Call Launcher

This n8n workflow periodically scans the `Leads` table for new leads (status `TVC`) and triggers outbound voice calls.

#### Steps:
1. **Trigger**: Scheduled trigger (every minute or manual)
2. **Airtable**: Query `Leads` where Status = `TVC`
3. **Prepare Call Data**: Format payload for Vapi API
4. **HTTP Request**: Send POST to `https://api.vapi.ai/call` with lead info
5. **Airtable**: Update lead status to `In Progress` and increment attempt

### ‚ö° Workflow 2: Call Feedback Listener

This webhook-based workflow handles post-call processing.

#### Trigger:
- **Webhook** (Production URL): `/webhook/vapi-callback`

#### Steps:
1. **Webhook**: Trigger on POST request from Vapi
2. **Validate Webhook Data**: Log and check structure
3. **Valid Data?**: Conditional node (true/false branch)
4. **Extract Call Data**: Parse phone number, time, duration, transcript
5. **Create Call Record**: Append to `Call Records` table
6. **Find Lead by Number**: Search `Leads` using mobile number
7. **Was Call Answered?**: If `status = completed`
8. **Update Status to Called**
9. **If Not Answered**:
    - Check if it was **First Attempt**
    - If yes: mark for **Retry Call**
    - If no: mark as **Failed**
