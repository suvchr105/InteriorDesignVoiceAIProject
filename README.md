# üè† Interior Design Voice AI Agent 

This project automates the qualification of interior design leads using voice AI agents, Airtable, and the n8n automation platform. It simulates a fully automated outbound voice call workflow that collects lead information and updates records based on real call results.

## üìå Project Overview

The Interior Design Voice AI Agent system comprises:

- **Voice AI Agent**: Built using [Vapi.ai](https://vapi.ai) and powered by an OpenAI LLM.
- **Two n8n Workflows**:
  - **Workflow 1: Outbound Call Launcher**
  - **Workflow 2: Call Result Processor**
- **Airtable**:
  - `Leads` table ‚Äì stores lead details and call status
  - `Call Records` table ‚Äì logs all call metadata, duration, transcripts

## üß† Workflow Summary

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Workflow 1: Outbound Call Launcher

This n8n workflow periodically scans the `Leads` table for new leads (status `TVC`) and triggers outbound voice calls.

#### Steps:
1. **Trigger**: Scheduled trigger (every minute or manual)
2. **Airtable**: Query `Leads` where Status = `TVC`
3. **Prepare Call Data**: Format payload for Vapi API
4. **HTTP Request**: Send POST to `https://api.vapi.ai/call` with lead info
5. **Airtable**: Update lead status to `In Progress` and increment attempt

### ‚ö° Workflow 2: Call Feedback Listener

This webhook-based workflow handles post-call processing.

#### Trigger:
- **Webhook** (Production URL): `/webhook/vapi-callback`

#### Steps:
1. **Webhook**: Trigger on POST request from Vapi
2. **Validate Webhook Data**: Log and check structure
3. **Valid Data?**: Conditional node (true/false branch)
4. **Extract Call Data**: Parse phone number, time, duration, transcript
5. **Create Call Record**: Append to `Call Records` table
6. **Find Lead by Number**: Search `Leads` using mobile number
7. **Was Call Answered?**: If `status = completed`
8. **Update Status to Called**
9. **If Not Answered**:
    - Check if it was **First Attempt**
    - If yes: mark for **Retry Call**
    - If no: mark as **Failed**
